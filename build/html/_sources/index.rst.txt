CellScope: High-Performance Cell Atlas Analysis with Tree-Structured Representation
======================================

CellScope is an efficient toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data, and its specific workflow is illustrated as follows. It integrates features such as gene selection and denoising through two-step manifold fitting, clustering and visualization, differential gene identification and plotting, and multi-scale, high-resolution cellular atlas construction. Compared to traditional methods, CellScope demonstrates superior performance across diverse single-cell datasets, significantly improving clustering accuracy and visualization clarity, enhancing computational efficiency, while reducing hyperparameter dependency and increasing algorithm interpretability.
