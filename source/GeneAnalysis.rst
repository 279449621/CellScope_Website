GeneAnalysis: ``ga``
==========================

Computing gene clustering and Wasserstein distance analysis between different cell clusters.

.. list-table::

   * - ``CellScope.ga.Gene_Analysis``
     - Calculate the Wasserstein distance for each gene between two clusters and classify genes based on distance thresholds.

   * - ``CellScope.ga.plot_sankey``
     - Plot a Sankey diagram to visualize gene type conversion flows across different clustering layers.
