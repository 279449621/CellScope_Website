GeneExpressionVisualizer: ``gev``
====================================================

Visualization of gene expression for different cell clusters using scatter plots, heatmaps, and violin plots.

.. list-table::

   * - ``CellScope.gev.scatter_gene_expression``
     - Create scatter plots of gene expression, with markers colored by expression levels.

   * - ``CellScope.gev.plot_mean_expression_heatmap``
     - Plot mean expression heatmap for marker genes across cell clusters.

   * - ``CellScope.gev.plot_clustered_heatmap``
     - Generate a clustered heatmap for marker gene expression across different cell clusters.

   * - ``CellScope.gev.compare_violin_plot_between_classes``
     - Compare gene expression distributions between two cell clusters using violin plots.
